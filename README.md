# Structured Binary Neural Networks for Image Recognition

created by [Bohan Zhuang](https://sites.google.com/view/bohanzhuang)

## [External code](http://hangzh.com/PyTorch-Encoding/)

- We use the [**PyTorch-Encoding**](http://hangzh.com/PyTorch-Encoding/) as code base. Please refer to Pytorch-Encoding for detailed instructions of installation and usage. 


## Training 
python train.py. We use the binary backbone pretrained on ImageNet as initialization. The pretrained binary backbone can be downloaded at [image classification repository](https://bitbucket.org/jingruixiaozhuang/group-net-image-classification/src/master/).

## Testing
python test.py
